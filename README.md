##Google Maps Assignment

This project was created as part of the technical assignment for an interview process. The project has a Google Map that can have an area highlighted via polyline, from which a nominal power for installation is calculated.

This project was created by me, Seunghun Oh, with the help of create-react-app and google-maps-react. All uses or sampling of the code must require my permission.
